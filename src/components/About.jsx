      <p>
        I'm a passionate and results-driven <strong>.NET Full Stack Developer</strong> with over <strong>1.6 years</strong> of experience in building scalable web applications and APIs. My core strengths lie in <strong>C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and React JS</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked extensively on designing and implementing RESTful APIs, integrating secure authentication flows, and optimizing database operations to ensure high-performance applications. My frontend skills in React JS allow me to create interactive and responsive user interfaces with seamless user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my journey, I’ve been a part of impactful projects like a Payroll Input System and an E-commerce platform, where I contributed to both backend logic and frontend integration. I'm also experienced in using tools like <strong>Git, Vercel, Postman, and SQL Server</strong> as part of my development workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love collaborating with cross-functional teams, learning new technologies, and solving real-world problems through clean and maintainable code. I'm constantly exploring ways to improve performance, code quality, and user experience.
